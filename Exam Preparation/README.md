1. Exercise with simple operations and calculations - reading and printing strings and numbers, variables, simple arithmetic operations.
2. Exercise with conditional constructions - conditional constructions(if, if-else), logical expressions.
3. Exercise with nested conditional constructions - nested conditional constructions, switch-case construction, logical operators.
4. Exercise with while-loop - while-loop, break operator for interrution of the loop.
5. Exercise with for-loop - incrementation, decrementation, for-loop.
6. Exercise with nested loops - nested loops.
